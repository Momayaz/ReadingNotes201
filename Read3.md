# Ordered Lists and unorder lists.
to make order list we have to put oppening and closing **ol** followed by **li** as the result will be order like 1.
2.
3.
**unorder list** use *ul* to make a list not ordered.

**Definition Lists.**
The definition list is created with
the **dl** element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
Inside the **dl** element you will
usually see pairs of **dt** and
**dd** elements.
**dt**
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
**dd**
This is used to contain the
definition.
**Nested Lists**
You can put a second list inside
an **li** element to create a sublist or nested list.
* There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
* Ordered lists use numbers.
* Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.
**address** chapter-02/address.html HTML
The **address** element has
quite a specific use: to contain
contact details for the author of
the page.
It can contain a physical address,
but it does not have to. For
example, it may also contain a
phone number or email address.

* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

**Box Dimensions
width, height**
By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties.
The most popular ways to
specify the size of a box are
to use pixels, percentages, or
ems. Traditionally, pixels have
been the most popular method
because they allow designers to
accurately control their size.
When you use percentages,
the size of the box is relative to
the size of the browser window
or, if the box is encased within
another box, it is a percentage of
the size of the containing box.
When you use ems, the size
of the box is based on the size
of text within it. Designers
have recently started to use
percentages and ems more for
measurements as they try to
create designs that are flexible
across devices which have
different-sized screens.
