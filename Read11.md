## Analytics: Learning about your Visitors:

1. Signing Up
The Google Analytics service
relies on you signing up for an
account at:
www.google.com/analytics
The site will give you a piece of
tracking code which you need to
put on every page of your site.
2. How it Works
Every time someone loads a
page of your site, the tracking
code sends data to the Google
servers where it is stored.
Google then provides a webbased interface that allows you
to see how visitors use your site.
3. The Tracking Code
A tracking code is provided
by Google Analytics for each
website you are tracking. It
should appear just before the
closing ```</head>``` tag. The code
does not alter the appearance of
your web pages.
